<!-- 
throwing ideas around

stock / library
option thing 0: look at "menu" of things available
option thing 1: put one in basket
option thing 2: buy the thing
option thing 3: return the thing

option thing x: donate to charity

calculation: how much did the store bring in
             how much did the charity bring in

you can return and fiddle with the store cash but not charity cash

----------------------------------------------

THOUGHTS:
Give charity bin its own class ?
Does the PLAY AGAIN bit need its own class ?

TO-DO:
Create inventory / Catalogue
Implement buying + paying system
Implement return + refund system 
Wallet

-----------------------------------------------

RIGHT NOW IT'S SOMETHING LIKE:

Option 1: Browse / Select thing to buy
    Select colour, size and material
    Confirm selection
        Or pick again
    NEEDED: Save selection / confirm purchase
Option 2: Return thing
Option 3: Exit store
