<!-- 
throwing ideas around

stock / library
option thing 0: look at "menu" of things available
option thing 1: put one in basket
option thing 2: buy the thing
option thing 3: return the thing

option thing x: donate to charity

calculation: how much did the store bring in
             how much did the charity bring in

you can return and fiddle with the store cash but not charity cash

----------------------------------------------

THOUGHTS:
Give charity bin its own class ?
'ware' is a pretty unfortunate term to use, I realised pretty late, but it had a vibe and I didn't care to change it to something less scary like "product" or whatever

TO-DO:
Implement buying + paying system + wallet
Charity system
>> TESTS + folder for pytest
>> Folder for saving 'stock and receipts' in a json file

-----------------------------------------------

RIGHT NOW IT'S SOMETHING LIKE:

Option 1: Browse / Select thing to buy
    Select colour, size and material
    Confirm selection
        Or pick again
    NEEDED: Purchase
Option 2: View basket
Option 3: Exit store
BUT WAIT! Charity bin
